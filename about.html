            <p>This is a website made with the guidance of Dr. Adam Anderson. It was made as part of the DigHum150A curriculum, as a project working with
                digital archives. The website is designed to be used by students of UC Berkeley's CS61A class, particularly those who are in my (Daphne's)
                discussion section. If you'd like to see more about how the site was made, go <a href="/howto.html">here</a>.
