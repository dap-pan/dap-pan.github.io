    <h1>About the Site</h1>
    <p>This is a website made with the guidance of Dr. Adam Anderson. It was made as part of the DigHum150A curriculum, as a project working with
        digital archives. The website is designed to be used by students of UC Berkeley's CS61A class, particularly those who are in my (Daphne's)
        discussion section.
